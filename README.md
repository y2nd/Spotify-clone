# Spotify-clone
A web app Spotify clone I built as part of my training to learn Nextjs. Not finished due to some problems of incompatibility between Recoil and NextJs.
Overall the app works just fine, it plays music and it successfully authenticates the user using their Spotify crendentials.

# Local Use:
Before launching the app you have to define some environment variables in an .env file at root directory: 

```
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost/3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_SECRET=
JWT_SECRET=

```

# Run
Run with the following command: 
```npm run dev```
